## 📊 Distribution Analysis

### Numerical Features
- **Tenure Distribution**: Shows customer longevity patterns through histograms and boxplots
- **Monthly Charges**: Displays the spread of customer billing amounts
- **Total Charges**: Illustrates cumulative payment patterns

### Customer Demographics
- Gender distribution with balanced representation
- Senior citizen composition (16% of customer base)
- Partner and dependent status visualized through sunburst charts

## 🔄 Churn Analysis

### Key Visualizations
1. **Churn Rate by Contract Type**
   - Month-to-month contracts show highest churn
   - Long-term contracts demonstrate better retention

2. **Payment Methods Impact**
   - Distribution across different payment options
   - Correlation with churn behavior

3. **Service Usage Patterns**
   - Internet service type influence on churn
   - Additional services adoption rates

## 📈 Advanced Visualizations

### Correlation and Relationships
1. **3D Scatter Plot**
   - Tenure vs Monthly Charges vs Total Charges
   - Color-coded by churn status
   - Contract type symbolization

2. **Parallel Categories Analysis**
   - Shows relationships between:
     - Internet Service
     - Contract Type
     - Payment Method
     - Churn Status

3. **Service Features Correlation**
   - Heatmap showing relationships between services
   - Impact on customer retention

## 🎯 Key Insights

1. **Contract Impact**
   - Month-to-month contracts have highest churn risk
   - Two-year contracts show strongest retention

2. **Service Relationships**
   - Fiber optic service users show distinct patterns
   - Technical support and security services correlation with retention

3. **Financial Patterns**
   - Monthly charges relationship with churn
   - Payment method influence on customer behavior

4. **Customer Segments**
   - Demographic influence on churn behavior
   - Service usage patterns across different segments

## 📉 Tenure Analysis

1. **Tenure Groups**
   - Distribution across 0-6 years
   - Churn probability by tenure group
   - Internet service type influence

2. **Violin Plots**
   - Monthly charges distribution by churn status
   - Total charges patterns with billing type

## 🔍 Service Analysis

1. **Internet Service Impact**
   - Distribution of contract types
   - Churn percentages by service type
   - Service adoption patterns

2. **Additional Services**
   - Online security impact
   - Technical support influence
   - Streaming services adoption

## 📱 Customer Services

1. **Phone Service Analysis**
   - Multiple lines distribution
   - Service combination patterns
   - Impact on customer retention

2. **Billing Preferences**
   - Paperless billing adoption
   - Payment method distribution
   - Correlation with customer behavior

These visualizations provide valuable insights for understanding customer behavior and developing targeted retention strategies.
